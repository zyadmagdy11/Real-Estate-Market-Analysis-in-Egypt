**Prepared for:** DEPI |
**Prepared by:** Mostafa Hamada |
**Date:** 30/2/2026 |
**Project Duration:** 4 Weeks  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive data science project to analyze the Egyptian real estate market. The goal is to collect and analyze real estate data from online platforms, uncover pricing trends, identify high-demand areas, and build a machine learning model to predict future apartment prices. The final deliverable includes an interactive dashboard for decision-makers to explore insights and make data-driven decisions.

The project will follow a complete data science pipeline: web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and visualization.

## 2. Introduction and Background

The Egyptian real estate market is growing rapidly, but stakeholders often lack access to clean, structured, and up-to-date data for informed decision-making. Real estate companies, investors, and buyers face challenges in understanding fair pricing, demand patterns, and competitive positioning.

This project aims to bridge that gap by building a data-driven solution that:
- Aggregates real estate listings from online platforms
- Analyzes market trends and pricing by location
- Predicts future apartment prices using machine learning
- Provides an interactive dashboard for exploring insights

## 3. Proposed Solution & Added Value

### Proposed Solution
I will develop a full data science pipeline including:

| Phase | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Collection** | Web scraping (BeautifulSoup/Selenium) from real estate websites + public APIs |
| **Data Cleaning** | Handle missing values, standardize formats, remove outliers |
| **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | Visualize price distributions, demand by area, company comparisons |
| **Feature Engineering** | Create new features (price per sqm, location clusters, amenities score) |
| **Machine Learning** | Train and compare models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict apartment prices |
| **Dashboard Development** | Build interactive dashboard using Streamlit/Dash with maps, charts, and prediction tool |
| **Insights & Recommendations** | Deliver actionable business insights for pricing, investment, and marketing |

### Added Value for You
- **For Real Estate Companies:** Optimize pricing strategies, understand competitors
- **For Investors:** Identify high-growth areas and undervalued properties
- **For Buyers:** Get fair price estimates before purchasing
- **For Analysts:** Track market trends with live or updated data
